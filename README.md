# Cataract-Detection-Deep-Learning
Cataract is one of the fast-growing eye diseases which mostly affects aged people. In this project, we have Implemented a Cataract detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks. This neural network consists of 16 layers out of which 8 layers are used for feature extraction while the rest of the 8 layers are used for classification.
